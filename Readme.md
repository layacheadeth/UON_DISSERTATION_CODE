My dissertation is about detecting deceptive reviews using deep learning algorithms.

Those algorithms are Convolutional Neural network (CNN), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), and an ensemble model which is a combination of CNN and LSTM. 
The dataset was acquired from Kaggle (a TripAdvisor dataset that includes a truthful and deceptive review from 20 hotels in Chicago, with 800 deceptive reviews and 800 truthful reviews).
