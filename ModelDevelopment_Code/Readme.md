# This is the development code of the deep learning model.

We have experimented with 5 algorithms. 

Our best developed model is an ensemble methods which consists of 2 convolutional neural network layers and one long-short term memory layer. 

We train using 50 epochs, with Adam as the optimizer. 

We received an accuracy of 75% of our best developed models.
