This hotel is perfect, IMO. Easy check in and check out. Lovely, clean, comfortable rooms with great views of the city. I know this area pretty well and it's very convenient to many downtown Chicago attractions. We had dinner and went clubing with our friends around Division St.. We had no problems getting cabs back and forth to the Hyatt and there's even public transportation right near by but we didn't bother since we only needed cabs from and to the hotel. Parking, as is usual for Chicago, was expensive but we were able to get our car out quickly (however, we left on a Sunday morning, not exactly a high traffic time although it was a Bears homegame day, so a bit busier than usual I would think). No problems at all and the best part is that we got a rate of $100 through Hotwire, a downright steal for this area of Chicago and the quality of the hotel. \\n</td>\n",

I was delayed from a very important client due to a latency issue with my reserved room, and if that was not enough. To top it off the room service had the nerve to bring up room temperature pasta and a bottle of champagne that had the seal previously broken free of the cork.

I felt like he was trying to pressure me into staying more days than I wanted to. Not only that, but I couldn't understand what he was saying most of the time because he was talking so fast. When I finally got to my room, I was disappointed with the quality of the furniture and the room's cleanliness. I had to ask for a maid to come and give me clean towels because some of the towels in the bathroom were damp. On top of that, the bed was messily done; I could have done a better job on my own bed at home. I was angry at this point, because I was paying a lot of money for every night I was staying at Amalfi, and I didn't expect to be greeted with wet towels. I needed to use the Wi-Fi to download some important documents, and the internet was surprisingly slow. Even a very basic hotel or motel could have offered better, maybe even faster internet access. When I finally checked out of the Amalfi, I made sure that my supposed personal concierge knew all of the problems I'd had with my room and the hotel. I was glad to see the Amalfi getting smaller in the mirror as I drove away!\\n</td>\n",

This hotel is perfect, IMO. Easy check in and check out. Lovely, clean, comfortable rooms with great views of the city. I know this area pretty well and it's very convenient to many downtown Chicago attractions. We had dinner and went clubing with our friends around Division St.. We had no problems getting cabs back and forth to the Hyatt and there's even public transportation right near by but we didn't bother since we only needed cabs from and to the hotel. Parking, as is usual for Chicago, was expensive but we were able to get our car out quickly (however, we left on a Sunday morning, not exactly a high traffic time although it was a Bears homegame day, so a bit busier than usual I would think). No problems at all and the best part is that we got a rate of $100 through Hotwire, a downright steal for this area of Chicago and the quality of the hotel. \\n  \n",

While this address in Chicago requires a high level of quality, the Omni delivers. Check in for myself and a whole group of people with me was under 3 minutes, the staff had plentiful recommendations for dining and events, and the rooms are some of the largest you'll find at this price range in Chicago. Even the 'standard' room has a separate living area and work desk. The fitness center has free weights, weight machines, and two rows of cardio equipment. I shared the room with 7 others and did not feel cramped in any way! All in all, a great property! \\n  \n",

The room was pleasantly decorated, functional and very clean. I didn't need a whole lot of service but when I did they were pleasant and prompt. I used the fitness center which was well equipped and everything was in working order. It is in a great location at one end of the Michigan Avenue shopping district. \\n  \n",

Somehow I managed to get my reservation, and wish I had looked elsewhere on this great Chicago street, filled with plenty of other options. The server errors continued at check in and didn't let up. I was on a holiday weekend, but far too many others must have been pushy conventioneers, and I had trouble getting served. The hotel is enormous and doesn't give a sense of comfort. The health facilities are also just too big, so noisy and crowded. And Internet access was $18 a day, kind of surprising when I can go around the corner to a Starbucks! Next time, I'll pick a more intimate place nearby--without so many 'server errors'.\\n  \n",

When my wife and I got here, we were given keys to a room that had not even been cleaned! The Internet access promised on the hotel's website was down, so I couldn't catch up on any of the business I had intended to do, and my wife thought that the dark design details in the room made her feel claustrophobic, like she was sleeping inside a Salvador Dali painting. All in all, this hotel was not worth the money, especially since we spent most of our time enjoying the city--something more casual and comfortable would have been better, and it would probably have been cleaner, too!\\n  \n",

For the cost of the rooms starting at 179.00 a night, you would think they would have a competent parking attendant. I was delayed from a very important client due to a latency issue with my reserved room, and if that was not enough. To top it off the room service had the nerve to bring up room temperature pasta and a bottle of champagne that had the seal previously broken free of the cork. Needless to say this will be the last time this hotel ever is to grace so much as another dollar bill from my account. I would highly recommend another hotel with better accommodations.\\n  \n",

When I went through, the lobby was dirty, my room hadn't been cleaned, and smelled thoroughly of smoke. When I requested more pillows, the lady on the phone scoffed at me and said she'd send them up. It took over an hour for 2 pillows. This hotel is a good example that what you pay for isn't always what you get. I will not be returning.\\n  \n",
       "1599  As a former Chicagoan, I'm appalled at the Amalfi Hotel Chicago. First of all, I was expecting luxury and hospitality, neither of which I received. There's an Experience Designer who is supposed to be like a 'personal concierge,' but my experience with my ED was terrible. I felt like he was trying to pressure me into staying more days than I wanted to. Not only that, but I couldn't understand what he was saying most of the time because he was talking so fast. When I finally got to my room, I was disappointed with the quality of the furniture and the room's cleanliness. I had to ask for a maid to come and give me clean towels because some of the towels in the bathroom were damp. On top of that, the bed was messily done; I could have done a better job on my own bed at home. I was angry at this point, because I was paying a lot of money for every night I was staying at Amalfi, and I didn't expect to be greeted with wet towels. I needed to use the Wi-Fi to download some important documents, and the internet was surprisingly slow. Even a very basic hotel or motel could have offered better, maybe even faster internet access. When I finally checked out of the Amalfi, I made sure that my supposed personal concierge knew all of the problems I'd had with my room and the hotel. I was glad to see the Amalfi getting smaller in the mirror as I drove away!\\n  \n",

       "      <td>the amalfi hotel has a beautiful website and interior decorating  but that s about it  when my wife and i got here  we were given keys to a room that had not even been cleaned  the internet access promised on the hotel s website was down  so i couldn t catch up on any of the business i had intended to do  and my wife thought that the dark design details in the room made her feel claustrophobic  like she was sleeping inside a salvador dali painting  all in all  this hotel was not worth the money  especially since we spent most of our time enjoying the city  something more casual and comfortable would have been better  and it would probably have been cleaner  too</td>\n",

       "      <td>as a former chicagoan  i m appalled at the amalfi hotel chicago  first of all  i was expecting luxury and hospitality  neither of which i received  there s an experience designer who is supposed to be like a  personal concierge   but my experience with my ed was terrible  i felt like he was trying to pressure me into staying more days than i wanted to  not only that  but i couldn t understand what he was saying most of the time because he was talking so fast  when i finally got to my room  i was disappointed with the quality of the furniture and the room s cleanliness  i had to ask for a maid to come and give me clean towels because some of the towels in the bathroom were damp  on top of that  the bed was messily done  i could have done a better job on my own bed at home  i was angry at this point  because i was paying a lot of money for every night i was staying at amalfi  and i didn t expect to be greeted with wet towels  i needed to use the wi fi to download some important documents  and the internet was surprisingly slow  even a very basic hotel or motel could have offered better  maybe even faster internet access  when i finally checked out of the amalfi  i made sure that my supposed personal concierge knew all of the problems i d had with my room and the hotel  i was glad to see the amalfi getting smaller in the mirror as i drove away</td>\n",

       "      <td>I had read some reviews saying that this bra ran small and so I ordered TWO band AND cup sizes UP and it was still too small!  Definitely along the lines of a sports bra squish effect.  The sides do come up high.  Glamorise is one the best brands for bras, so I'm very surprised with this one.  The front close idea appealed to me, but look carefully, there are 7 (yes, seven) clasps to do up.  What a pain.  I think if I had ordered 3 sizes up it might be ok.  I won't return it as I'm losing weight, so it might fit better down the road.  Will update review at that time.  If you want a bra that doesn't let you jiggle at all without it being a minimizer and/or without wires, this would be good.\\n\\nUPDATE:  After very recent gallbladder surgery that left me with a highly tender incision site, I found I couldn't wear any of my regular bras.  I had ordered this one hoping I might be able to tolerate it.  Initially, because it was so tight, I couldn't tolerate this one either.  As I slowly healed, I kept trying the bra.  Due to its elastic nature I was able to adjust this for comfort more than the others.  After about two weeks, much to my amazement, I found the bra had lost its initial snugness and was in fact VERY comfortable!  5 weeks after surgery and this is still the only bra I can tolerate.  The number of clasps in the front turned out to be a bonus as well, because I could choose to leave the bottom clasps undone, adding to the comfort level.  I am still of the opinion that it runs too snug and I'm glad I ordered up.\\n\\nTake the time to break the bra in!  All bras have a break-in period (in my opinion), and this one is no different.  I'm actually quite happy with it now.</td>\n",

How is that for 3-in-1 systems?\\n\\nReminiscent of what Lands End sells as a \"Squall Jacket\", or what uniform and corporate wear sellers call a Three Season Jacket.\\n\\nWater and wind resistant shell.  Microfleece lined body.  Smooth polyester lining in sleeves.  Left hand side, Napoleon style, inside pocket with a hook and loop closure.  Adjustable sleeve cuffs.  Hemline cinch cord with toggles.  Molded plastic chain style, off brand, slide fastener.\\n\\nPolyester insulation is spilling out due to poor quality stitching.  Item was delivered with a broken main zipper.\\n\\nI can wear this jacket over just a t-shirt, and expect to stay warm @ 72 degrees Fahrenheit, and no wind.\\n\\nIf it was foggy, or there's a light drizzle, I would have no problem depending on this jacket to go 300 - 500 feet in order to get to my car in the parking lot.\\n\\nBetter garments feature Gore-Tex, Hippora, HyVent, DWR.....this jacket features no technology.  You're just hoping that the polyester does not saturate as you're trying to get where you're going.  You will not be going for bike rides, checking your property's fence line by horseback, riding a motorcycle, playing golf, pier fishing, lap dancing, picking strawberries, calling ducks, or anything else in the rain.\\n\\nI guess if you name your company, 32Degrees Weatherproof, the customer does not have a reasonable expectation that your garments will keep them dry &amp; warm.\\n\\nGarment fits tight across the shoulders, back, chest, and arms.  Go 1 size up if you intend on layering.\\n\\nI've purchased other items from this manufacturer, and frankly, this item was a let down.  It's not warm enough when I need it to be warm.  I put on a few layers, and it is too tight.  I need to stay dry, and I'm sooooo wet.\\n\\nAnd to sell a jacket as a 3-in-1 systems jacket........it needs to really be a 3-in-1 systems jacket.  This jacket does not have a removeable liner!</td>\n",

       "      <td>I liked nothing about this dress. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I ordered the size 6.5 and it fit perfectly. The fabric is a nice thin material and the color is vibrant. It's a little thin on me but it's worth it. The material is soft and comfortable. I love the color and the fit. I'm 5'4\" and it fits just right. I'm a size 6 and it's a bit long on me so I ordered a 6 in order to fit the smaller size. I'm 5'3\" and it fits perfect and I got it in a medium. It's a nice dress and I'm very pleased with it. I like that it's a bit small for me and I can wear it with a top or skirt. I also like that the fabric is made of a good material. I wear a size 5 and it fits well. I'm 5'3\" and it fits just right. I'm 5'6\" and it fits just right. I'm 5'4\" and it fits just right. I wear a size 10.5 and it's a little tight on me. I have a small waist and it's not too tight on me. It's a nice little dress. I will buy more colors.Very nice dress.  It is well made and it is very comfortable.  I received a free sample and will see if I can wear it again.  I would definitely buy another one.  I am very happy with this dress.I love these boots!  I have been wearing them for almost 8 months now and I love them so much that I purchased a second pair.  They are very comfortable and look great.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I work in the wedding industry and have to work long days, on my feet, outside in the heat, and have to look professional. I've spent a ridiculous amount of money on high end dress shoes like Merrels and just have not been able to find a pair that are comfortable to wear all day. Both for my feet and my back. Enter the Sanuk yoga sling!!! These shoes are amazingly comfortable. Though, I will admit it took a few wears to get used to the feel of the yoga matte bottom. At first, it felt a little \"sticky\" to me, and the fabric part that goes through the toe area was a little thick and took some getting used to. I wore them for a few days before taking them out on a job and I can't get over how comfortable they are. Ii have been wearing these shoes now for 3 months, every work day and I am THRILLED. No more back pain, no more sore feet. I also wear these sometimes during my off time,mans every time I wear them, I get compliments on how cute and comfortable they look. The great thing about these shoes is the yoga matte bottom. It helps your feet grip to the shoe a bit, so your foot can just walk normally, without having to grip the shoe. You may not realize it, but with a lot of Sandals, your foot is having to work to keep the shoe on, changing the way you walk and stand and ultimately causing foot and back pain. Not with these! Also, the soft linen sits comfortably on your skin and breathes nicely in the heat. The only downside is the funky tan lines, which is why I am sure to alternate shoes on my days off, especially if I plan to be outside for most of the day. If it were not for that, I think these might be the only shoes I'd wear all summer. If you are looking for a reasonable priced, comfortable shoe that you can wear and walk in all day.</td>\n",

Definitely along the lines of a sports bra squish effect.  The sides do come up high.  Glamorise is one the best brands for bras, so I'm very surprised with this one.  The front close idea appealed to me, but look carefully, there are 7 (yes, seven) clasps to do up.  What a pain.  I think if I had ordered 3 sizes up it might be ok.  I won't return it as I'm losing weight, so it might fit better down the road.  Will update review at that time.  If you want a bra that doesn't let you jiggle at all without it being a minimizer and/or without wires, this would be good.\\n\\nUPDATE:  After very recent gallbladder surgery that left me with a highly tender incision site, I found I couldn't wear any of my regular bras.  I had ordered this one hoping I might be able to tolerate it.  Initially, because it was so tight, I couldn't tolerate this one either.  As I slowly healed, I kept trying the bra.  Due to its elastic nature I was able to adjust this for comfort more than the others.  After about two weeks, much to my amazement, I found the bra had lost its initial snugness and was in fact VERY comfortable!  5 weeks after surgery and this is still the only bra I can tolerate.  The number of clasps in the front turned out to be a bonus as well, because I could choose to leave the bottom clasps undone, adding to the comfort level.  I am still of the opinion that it runs too snug and I'm glad I ordered up.\\n\\nTake the time to break the bra in!  All bras have a break-in period (in my opinion), and this one is no different.  I'm actually quite happy with it now.  \n",

It is a little large for my small size, but I think it is a nice fit.  The fabric is a nice thin material, but it is a little thin in the legs.  I wish it was thicker.  The material is soft and comfortable.  I will keep it.  I ordered a half size up and it fits great.  I wear a 9 1/2.  I like that the strap is longer than the waistband, which is nice.  I am 5'5\" and the size 6 fits great.  I am a medium.  The bra is too short.  It is a little narrow for me, but I think it would be a nice addition to my wardrobe.  I will be buying another one in different colors.  I have a small tummy and I ordered a medium.  I wear a 9 1/2 in pants.  I would recommend this bra.  I am 5'8\" and the length was perfect.  I love the color and it is very comfortable.\\nI would recommend this to anyone.I was very happy with this shirt!  It's very pretty and the fabric is soft and nice!  The fit is perfect!

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I ordered the size 6.5 and it fit perfectly. The fabric is a nice thin material and the color is vibrant. It's a little thin on me but it's worth it. The material is soft and comfortable. I love the color and the fit. I'm 5'4\" and it fits just right. I'm a size 6 and it's a bit long on me so I ordered a 6 in order to fit the smaller size. I'm 5'3\" and it fits perfect and I got it in a medium. It's a nice dress and I'm very pleased with it. I like that it's a bit small for me and I can wear it with a top or skirt. I also like that the fabric is made of a good material. I wear a size 5 and it fits well. I'm 5'3\" and it fits just right. I'm 5'6\" and it fits just right. I'm 5'4\" and it fits just right. I wear a size 10.5 and it's a little tight on me. I have a small waist and it's not too tight on me. It's a nice little dress. I will buy more colors.Very nice dress.  It is well made and it is very comfortable.  I received a free sample and will see if I can wear it again.  I would definitely buy another one.  I am very happy with this dress.I love these boots!

I've spent a ridiculous amount of money on high end dress shoes like Merrels and just have not been able to find a pair that are comfortable to wear all day. Both for my feet and my back. Enter the Sanuk yoga sling!!! These shoes are amazingly comfortable. Though, I will admit it took a few wears to get used to the feel of the yoga matte bottom. At first, it felt a little \"sticky\" to me, and the fabric part that goes through the toe area was a little thick and took some getting used to. I wore them for a few days before taking them out on a job and I can't get over how comfortable they are. Ii have been wearing these shoes now for 3 months, every work day and I am THRILLED. No more back pain, no more sore feet. I also wear these sometimes during my off time,mans every time I wear them, I get compliments on how cute and comfortable they look. The great thing about these shoes is the yoga matte bottom. It helps your feet grip to the shoe a bit, so your foot can just walk normally, without having to grip the shoe. You may not realize it, but with a lot of Sandals, your foot is having to work to keep the shoe on, changing the way you walk and stand and ultimately causing foot and back pain. Not with these!

Enter the Sanuk yoga sling!!! These shoes are amazingly comfortable. Though, I will admit it took a few wears to get used to the feel of the yoga matte bottom. At first, it felt a little \"sticky\" to me, and the fabric part that goes through the toe area was a little thick and took some getting used to. I wore them for a few days before taking them out on a job and I can't get over how comfortable they are. Ii have been wearing these shoes now for 3 months, every work day and I am THRILLED. No more back pain, no more sore feet. I also wear these sometimes during my off time,mans every time I wear them, I get compliments on how cute and comfortable they look. The great thing about these shoes is the yoga matte bottom. It helps your feet grip to the shoe a bit, so your foot can just walk normally, without having to grip the shoe.

I received this book free from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. This book was a total shocker. It's very sad that this book is out of print. The author, William F. Martin, wrote a book that was so bad it's hard to put down. However, the author went out of his way to make the book look like a ghost story. It's a shame because this is one of the worst books I have read in a long time. I'm going to read it again. I really enjoyed the book. It's a great read.

I won't be buying another Wheel of Time book in hardcover. In fact, I may just go to the library and check a copy out next time, rather than even buying it in paperback.\\nI used to be impressed by Jordan's ability to have so many plot threads going on at once, and yet tying them all together.  Now I'm just bored by it.  He has too many characters doing their own little thing in their own little places... I can't fault him too much for not moving the series forward, the problem is with the way he has the story set up, he _Can't_.  There are too many plots... but he could do a much better job in focusing in on those plots and making something happen within them.  The female characters are extremely under-developed.  They're all so similar...  But again, an author must have a hard time developing characters when he's thrown so many into the mix.\\nThe end of this book was fairly decent.

It has a lot of interesting historical information. The characters are interesting, and the plots are very interesting. I think this is one of the better novels on the subject. This is a great read for anyone interested in history. I received this book free from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. This book was a total shocker. It's very sad that this book is out of print. The author, William F. Martin, wrote a book that was so bad it's hard to put down. However, the author went out of his way to make the book look like a ghost story. It's a shame because this is one of the worst books I have read in a long time. I'm going to read it again. I really enjoyed the book. It's a great read. I can't wait for the next book in this series.   \n",

I gave Jordan three chances to get the series back to what it used to be, and it's just not happening.  I won't be buying another Wheel of Time book in hardcover. In fact, I may just go to the library and check a copy out next time, rather than even buying it in paperback.\\nI used to be impressed by Jordan's ability to have so many plot threads going on at once, and yet tying them all together.  Now I'm just bored by it.  He has too many characters doing their own little thing in their own little places... I can't fault him too much for not moving the series forward, the problem is with the way he has the story set up, he _Can't_.  There are too many plots... but he could do a much better job in focusing in on those plots and making something happen within them.  The female characters are extremely under-developed.  They're all so similar...  But again, an author must have a hard time developing characters when he's thrown so many into the mix.\\nThe end of this book was fairly decent.  I can't say this book was better than the last two, however.   \n",

I love the color and the fact that the hose is a little longer than I expected. This one has a nice white finish. I like that the hose is longer than the one I had. The hose has a small, rubber ring that helps keep it clean.   \n",

It's a little too heavy for my liking and i'm sure there are people who may like their knives this way i don't. You would be happier to spend a few extra dollars and get a american made knife that has some quality. It did not come with that hair popping blade that i was hoping for, it could barely pass the paper cutting test and that finish that Gerber puts on their blades, whats that all about? I guess i'm just spoiled by Buck Knives.....   \n",

The light is bright, and the light is very bright.  I used this to light up the kitchen in the dining room.  I would recommend this to anyone who needs a light that is bright enough to light up the kitchen.  I would also recommend this light to anyone who is looking for a good quality LED light that will last a long time.
