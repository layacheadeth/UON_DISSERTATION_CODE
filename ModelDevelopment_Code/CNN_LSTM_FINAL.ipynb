This hotel is perfect, IMO. Easy check in and check out. Lovely, clean, comfortable rooms with great views of the city. I know this area pretty well and it's very convenient to many downtown Chicago attractions. We had dinner and went clubing with our friends around Division St.. We had no problems getting cabs back and forth to the Hyatt and there's even public transportation right near by but we didn't bother since we only needed cabs from and to the hotel. Parking, as is usual for Chicago, was expensive but we were able to get our car out quickly (however, we left on a Sunday morning, not exactly a high traffic time although it was a Bears homegame day, so a bit busier than usual I would think). No problems at all and the best part is that we got a rate of $100 through Hotwire, a downright steal for this area of Chicago and the quality of the hotel. \\n</td>\n",

Even the 'standard' room has a separate living area and work desk. The fitness center has free weights, weight machines, and two rows of cardio equipment.

I was on a holiday weekend, but far too many others must have been pushy conventioneers, and I had trouble getting served. The hotel is enormous and doesn't give a sense of comfort. The health facilities are also just too big, so noisy and crowded. And Internet access was $18 a day, kind of surprising when I can go around the corner to a Starbucks!

I was delayed from a very important client due to a latency issue with my reserved room, and if that was not enough. To top it off the room service had the nerve to bring up room temperature pasta and a bottle of champagne that had the seal previously broken free of the cork.

There's an Experience Designer who is supposed to be like a 'personal concierge,' but my experience with my ED was terrible. I felt like he was trying to pressure me into staying more days than I wanted to. Not only that, but I couldn't understand what he was saying most of the time because he was talking so fast. When I finally got to my room, I was disappointed with the quality of the furniture and the room's cleanliness. I had to ask for a maid to come and give me clean towels because some of the towels in the bathroom were damp. On top of that, the bed was messily done; I could have done a better job on my own bed at home. I was angry at this point, because I was paying a lot of money for every night I was staying at Amalfi, and I didn't expect to be greeted with wet towels. I needed to use the Wi-Fi to download some important documents, and the internet was surprisingly slow. Even a very basic hotel or motel could have offered better, maybe even faster internet access. When I finally checked out of the Amalfi, I made sure that my supposed personal concierge knew all of the problems I'd had with my room and the hotel. I was glad to see the Amalfi getting smaller in the mirror as I drove away!\\n</td>\n",

This hotel is perfect, IMO. Easy check in and check out. Lovely, clean, comfortable rooms with great views of the city. I know this area pretty well and it's very convenient to many downtown Chicago attractions. We had dinner and went clubing with our friends around Division St.. We had no problems getting cabs back and forth to the Hyatt and there's even public transportation right near by but we didn't bother since we only needed cabs from and to the hotel. Parking, as is usual for Chicago, was expensive but we were able to get our car out quickly (however, we left on a Sunday morning, not exactly a high traffic time although it was a Bears homegame day, so a bit busier than usual I would think). No problems at all and the best part is that we got a rate of $100 through Hotwire, a downright steal for this area of Chicago and the quality of the hotel. \\n  \n",

While this address in Chicago requires a high level of quality, the Omni delivers. Check in for myself and a whole group of people with me was under 3 minutes, the staff had plentiful recommendations for dining and events, and the rooms are some of the largest you'll find at this price range in Chicago. Even the 'standard' room has a separate living area and work desk. The fitness center has free weights, weight machines, and two rows of cardio equipment. I shared the room with 7 others and did not feel cramped in any way! All in all, a great property! \\n  \n",

The room was pleasantly decorated, functional and very clean. I didn't need a whole lot of service but when I did they were pleasant and prompt. I used the fitness center which was well equipped and everything was in working order. It is in a great location at one end of the Michigan Avenue shopping district. \\n  \n",

Somehow I managed to get my reservation, and wish I had looked elsewhere on this great Chicago street, filled with plenty of other options. The server errors continued at check in and didn't let up. I was on a holiday weekend, but far too many others must have been pushy conventioneers, and I had trouble getting served. The hotel is enormous and doesn't give a sense of comfort. The health facilities are also just too big, so noisy and crowded. And Internet access was $18 a day, kind of surprising when I can go around the corner to a Starbucks! Next time, I'll pick a more intimate place nearby--without so many 'server errors'.\\n  \n",

When my wife and I got here, we were given keys to a room that had not even been cleaned! The Internet access promised on the hotel's website was down, so I couldn't catch up on any of the business I had intended to do, and my wife thought that the dark design details in the room made her feel claustrophobic, like she was sleeping inside a Salvador Dali painting. All in all, this hotel was not worth the money, especially since we spent most of our time enjoying the city--something more casual and comfortable would have been better, and it would probably have been cleaner, too!\\n  \n",

For the cost of the rooms starting at 179.00 a night, you would think they would have a competent parking attendant. I was delayed from a very important client due to a latency issue with my reserved room, and if that was not enough. To top it off the room service had the nerve to bring up room temperature pasta and a bottle of champagne that had the seal previously broken free of the cork. Needless to say this will be the last time this hotel ever is to grace so much as another dollar bill from my account. I would highly recommend another hotel with better accommodations.\\n  \n",

When I went through, the lobby was dirty, my room hadn't been cleaned, and smelled thoroughly of smoke. When I requested more pillows, the lady on the phone scoffed at me and said she'd send them up. It took over an hour for 2 pillows. This hotel is a good example that what you pay for isn't always what you get. I will not be returning.\\n  \n",
       "1599  As a former Chicagoan, I'm appalled at the Amalfi Hotel Chicago. First of all, I was expecting luxury and hospitality, neither of which I received. There's an Experience Designer who is supposed to be like a 'personal concierge,' but my experience with my ED was terrible. I felt like he was trying to pressure me into staying more days than I wanted to. Not only that, but I couldn't understand what he was saying most of the time because he was talking so fast. When I finally got to my room, I was disappointed with the quality of the furniture and the room's cleanliness. I had to ask for a maid to come and give me clean towels because some of the towels in the bathroom were damp. On top of that, the bed was messily done; I could have done a better job on my own bed at home. I was angry at this point, because I was paying a lot of money for every night I was staying at Amalfi, and I didn't expect to be greeted with wet towels. I needed to use the Wi-Fi to download some important documents, and the internet was surprisingly slow. Even a very basic hotel or motel could have offered better, maybe even faster internet access. When I finally checked out of the Amalfi, I made sure that my supposed personal concierge knew all of the problems I'd had with my room and the hotel. I was glad to see the Amalfi getting smaller in the mirror as I drove away!\\n  \n",

       "      <td>the amalfi hotel has a beautiful website and interior decorating  but that s about it  when my wife and i got here  we were given keys to a room that had not even been cleaned  the internet access promised on the hotel s website was down  so i couldn t catch up on any of the business i had intended to do  and my wife thought that the dark design details in the room made her feel claustrophobic  like she was sleeping inside a salvador dali painting  all in all  this hotel was not worth the money  especially since we spent most of our time enjoying the city  something more casual and comfortable would have been better  and it would probably have been cleaner  too</td>\n",

       "      <td>as a former chicagoan  i m appalled at the amalfi hotel chicago  first of all  i was expecting luxury and hospitality  neither of which i received  there s an experience designer who is supposed to be like a  personal concierge   but my experience with my ed was terrible  i felt like he was trying to pressure me into staying more days than i wanted to  not only that  but i couldn t understand what he was saying most of the time because he was talking so fast  when i finally got to my room  i was disappointed with the quality of the furniture and the room s cleanliness  i had to ask for a maid to come and give me clean towels because some of the towels in the bathroom were damp  on top of that  the bed was messily done  i could have done a better job on my own bed at home  i was angry at this point  because i was paying a lot of money for every night i was staying at amalfi  and i didn t expect to be greeted with wet towels  i needed to use the wi fi to download some important documents  and the internet was surprisingly slow  even a very basic hotel or motel could have offered better  maybe even faster internet access  when i finally checked out of the amalfi  i made sure that my supposed personal concierge knew all of the problems i d had with my room and the hotel  i was glad to see the amalfi getting smaller in the mirror as i drove away</td>\n",

       "160  the omni chicago is hands down  the best hotel in my opinion in the chicago area  i am a neat freak but here you need not worry about cleanliness as they are the best at keeping the rooms tidy  our check in was easy and fast and the staff at the hotel was very courteous and friendly  i forgot my hair dryer but thankfully  one of the many perks at this hotel  they provide one for you in your room  that s a small benefit compared to the lucious pool and dreamy massages they offer  i have never had a massage like that before  my favortie thing about the omni is the high speed wireless internet that is available to all guests  i am able to do my work online in all areas of the hotel which saved me a lot of time as i was not at my office but still had a lot of work to get done  i also loved the tv they provide in the room  a big plasma with a beautiful  crisp picture  i don t even have that at home  needless to say  i spent almost all night lounging in the comfortable bed watching movies only to fall asleep and wake up to the newspaper delivered to my hotel door in the morning  i will be coming back to the omni on my next trip to chicago  that s a promise      \n",

I booked this hotel because of the expected value for a suite as well as the free breakfast - get a quick bite, then head out for the day to do normal tourist stuff. Well, our stay here lasted 1 night and we quickly, and thankfully, switched to a different hotel for our last 4 nights. The room was dirty. When we opened the sofabed, the sheets were filthy and there was a mess of dirt and crumbs that fell out. Ridiculous considering this is a suite hotel where the sofabeds are likely used, and theoretically cleaned, a lot. Extra blankets were also dirty and bathrooms weren't much better. Temperature control in the room was imprecise - minor inconvenience but without clean blankets on our only night, it made for a cold stay. If you like to eat for free (they have free breakfasts and dinner on certain nights) and don't care to eat the great food Chicago has to offer, I guess some may find this place tolerable. But we found the buffet no better than average and felt like we were at a Golden Corral. The only thing this hotel really has going for it is location but there are other options in this area (we switched to The James and had a great experience). I couldn't be paid to stay here again. I'm shocked by the high overall rating given our experience.\"\n",

       "      <td>just got back from three nights at the knickerbocker  went up to chicago for some last minute christmas shopping  hotel is in a great location  north end of michigan ave  about half a block away  staff was very nice and professional  everyone we came in contact with was very helpful  granted this is a older hotel and some of the rooms are no bigger than closets  we were booked into a standard room and when we arrived we upgraded to a deluxe room  good size room  with nice furnishings and a comfortable bed  bathroom was somewhat small  housekeeping did a great job cleaning the room every day  did not eat at the restaurant nix  but saw several people getting orders delivered to the bar  overheard comments saying the food was very good  drink service at the martini bar can be slow  martinis run   and up  very good drinks and they don t shy away from the liquor  valet parking was   a day with in out priviliges  overall a great stay  would definately stay at this hotel in the future</td>\n",

       "      <td>this hotel is ok but is not the best for the money  first of all the parking prices are exorbitant  i know parking is at a premium for this location but the price is much too high  also  the service at this hotel was poor  i felt like room service took too long and considering the price the service was poor in general  and the staff at the palmer house seemed more interested in helping the richer or more known customers more than us  in addition i feel that there were too many fees including a fee for internet  also the rooms were very clean and beds very nice but there was some noise and you could hear the people walking above you  i would say it was an average experience at this hotel and considering the price maybe think twice about the palmer house</td>\n",

       "      <td>after reading all the lukewarm reviews for this hotel  i went ahead and got an ambassador membership just to hedge off any unpleasantness  i normally have a good experience with intercontinental hotels  particularly the mark hopkins in sf  i called the hotel directly to confirm that my reservation was designated as ambassador club  when i arrived at the hotel  there was no separate check in line  as advertised  and the manager on duty basically ignored me when i told him i was an ambassador club member and stuck me with a regular tiny room  i was nearly half an hour checking in the room and had to deal with the arrogant attitude of the manager on duty  they gave me a room in the  modern  tower   built in the  s  which was about   the size of a regular room at the mark hopkins  built in     i had to deal with torn sheets  cracked marble sinks  and the spare roll of toilet paper being located outside the bathroom inside the closet   how convenient is that  the closet door  if you are not careful  may break the full length mirror attached to the bathroom door  i was not provided with a key to the minibar and i called for turndown service  which never happened  the next day  they finally got around to the fact that i was an ambassador club member and entitled to an upgraded room  but since i travel with a medical device which i already set up in the tiny room  i declined  to their credit  they did send some of the amenities i would otherwise be entitled to as an ambassador club member  i would not stay at this hotel next time i go to chicago  there are other better places for the money including  the omni  the james  the fairmont  hyatt  sheraton  monaco  crowne plaza  even the holiday inn and marriotts located in the same general area</td>\n",

       "319  after reading all the lukewarm reviews for this hotel  i went ahead and got an ambassador membership just to hedge off any unpleasantness  i normally have a good experience with intercontinental hotels  particularly the mark hopkins in sf  i called the hotel directly to confirm that my reservation was designated as ambassador club  when i arrived at the hotel  there was no separate check in line  as advertised  and the manager on duty basically ignored me when i told him i was an ambassador club member and stuck me with a regular tiny room  i was nearly half an hour checking in the room and had to deal with the arrogant attitude of the manager on duty  they gave me a room in the  modern  tower   built in the  s  which was about   the size of a regular room at the mark hopkins  built in     i had to deal with torn sheets  cracked marble sinks  and the spare roll of toilet paper being located outside the bathroom inside the closet   how convenient is that  the closet door  if you are not careful  may break the full length mirror attached to the bathroom door  i was not provided with a key to the minibar and i called for turndown service  which never happened  the next day  they finally got around to the fact that i was an ambassador club member and entitled to an upgraded room  but since i travel with a medical device which i already set up in the tiny room  i declined  to their credit  they did send some of the amenities i would otherwise be entitled to as an ambassador club member  i would not stay at this hotel next time i go to chicago  there are other better places for the money including  the omni  the james  the fairmont  hyatt  sheraton  monaco  crowne plaza  even the holiday inn and marriotts located in the same general area     \n",

I booked this hotel because of the expected value for a suite as well as the free breakfast - get a quick bite, then head out for the day to do normal tourist stuff. Well, our stay here lasted 1 night and we quickly, and thankfully, switched to a different hotel for our last 4 nights. The room was dirty. When we opened the sofabed, the sheets were filthy and there was a mess of dirt and crumbs that fell out. Ridiculous considering this is a suite hotel where the sofabeds are likely used, and theoretically cleaned, a lot. Extra blankets were also dirty and bathrooms weren't much better. Temperature control in the room was imprecise - minor inconvenience but without clean blankets on our only night, it made for a cold stay. If you like to eat for free (they have free breakfasts and dinner on certain nights) and don't care to eat the great food Chicago has to offer, I guess some may find this place tolerable. But we found the buffet no better than average and felt like we were at a Golden Corral. The only thing this hotel really has going for it is location but there are other options in this area (we switched to The James and had a great experience). I couldn't be paid to stay here again. I'm shocked by the high overall rating given our experience.\"\n",

We needed to push the bed aside slightly just to open the front door. The luggage filled spaces with beds so we had to pack away the chair and move the kettle and coffee/tea to a bedside table just so we could access it.We were okay with it but it felt like we were on top of each other and it was hard to keep the room tidy since there was just no room to do anything.The breakfast is limited and only available in a one-hour window, so we didn't pay for it and went for pastries and fruit or other nearby breakfasts nearby instead.On our final day we were looking forward to good showers before heading out on a long day of travel, but the water was ice cold.

    "new_text = \"Trigger warning : this is a long reviewAs an asian/american from california, first time UK traveller, this walking/train commuting is all new to me. I did alot of researching and review reading to make sure that i would choose the right hotel for my taste.I chose Athena:first for the location. It is VERY close to paddington station, which is kinda the main hub going to london's outskirts, heathrow express and also close to the the tubes ( did i say that correctly ). Also ALOT of restaurants, convenient store and laundry place is very close as well.Second reason is that most of the reviews i saw online was positive. My stay here felt like im their house guest. Room service is done everyday, fresh towels and very clean room. Breakfast is complimentary. My first day we went to durdle door and needed to bring snacks for the trip, the very nice lady from the kitchen let us borrow her lunchbox so we can bring the porridge while driving.. so sweet of her.Third reason is that the staff are all amazing and very friendly.Mario Jr, who helped us check in and settle our car parking ( we rented a car so we can just drive outside london for 3 days. Parking is $15 per day, book early coz its limited spots)Mo from night shift was also nice, funny guy as well.And for Meliha, she was very accomodating, friendly and helpful.For the rooms, its cute, small but cozy. Typical bed and breakfast. Bathroom is medium size, shower has a rainfall shower head and handheld so you can use both. maybe the only thing i didnt like is that the shower glass is only half of the shower area, so put like a towel on the floor so you wont slip when you get out of the shower area.They also have luggage storage which is very convenient if you're planning to go somewhere then come back.Overall, my stay at Athena was amazing. I felt at home.Thank you everyone and keep up the good work.\"\n",

The molding on the walls were cracked and peeling. The beds we requested were correct in number, however the covers were old and dingy, matching the curtains. Upon arrival, we also found out that they do not have air conditioning, which according to the receptionist they do not advertise ?? As a result, since it was London in July, we had to keep the windows open to let in the slightest bit of breeze. So immediately (since there were no screens) flies and insects began swarming into the room. So not only was it hot, we were being bitten by insects and couldn't sleep at all. The hotels right on a major street, so every few minutes a honking bus or taxi would drive by. And the best part?? They have a no exception refund policy. So after a poor breakfast of eggs and beans (like seriously, they only had an English breakfast and some cereal options) we checked out and found another hotel. I've contacted Expedia to see about getting a refund on their end but have received no word back. Definitely not a three star hotel, and should not be advertised on Expedia! Not a good experience at all\"\n",

Definitely along the lines of a sports bra squish effect.  The sides do come up high.  Glamorise is one the best brands for bras, so I'm very surprised with this one.  The front close idea appealed to me, but look carefully, there are 7 (yes, seven) clasps to do up.  What a pain.  I think if I had ordered 3 sizes up it might be ok.  I won't return it as I'm losing weight, so it might fit better down the road.  Will update review at that time.  If you want a bra that doesn't let you jiggle at all without it being a minimizer and/or without wires, this would be good.\\n\\nUPDATE:  After very recent gallbladder surgery that left me with a highly tender incision site, I found I couldn't wear any of my regular bras.  I had ordered this one hoping I might be able to tolerate it.  Initially, because it was so tight, I couldn't tolerate this one either.  As I slowly healed, I kept trying the bra.  Due to its elastic nature I was able to adjust this for comfort more than the others.  After about two weeks, much to my amazement, I found the bra had lost its initial snugness and was in fact VERY comfortable!  5 weeks after surgery and this is still the only bra I can tolerate.  The number of clasps in the front turned out to be a bonus as well, because I could choose to leave the bottom clasps undone, adding to the comfort level.  I am still of the opinion that it runs too snug and I'm glad I ordered up.\\n\\nTake the time to break the bra in!  All bras have a break-in period (in my opinion), and this one is no different.  I'm actually quite happy with it now.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I work in the wedding industry and have to work long days, on my feet, outside in the heat, and have to look professional. I've spent a ridiculous amount of money on high end dress shoes like Merrels and just have not been able to find a pair that are comfortable to wear all day. Both for my feet and my back. Enter the Sanuk yoga sling!!! These shoes are amazingly comfortable. Though, I will admit it took a few wears to get used to the feel of the yoga matte bottom. At first, it felt a little \"sticky\" to me, and the fabric part that goes through the toe area was a little thick and took some getting used to. I wore them for a few days before taking them out on a job and I can't get over how comfortable they are. Ii have been wearing these shoes now for 3 months, every work day and I am THRILLED. No more back pain, no more sore feet. I also wear these sometimes during my off time,mans every time I wear them, I get compliments on how cute and comfortable they look. The great thing about these shoes is the yoga matte bottom. It helps your feet grip to the shoe a bit, so your foot can just walk normally, without having to grip the shoe. You may not realize it, but with a lot of Sandals, your foot is having to work to keep the shoe on, changing the way you walk and stand and ultimately causing foot and back pain. Not with these! Also, the soft linen sits comfortably on your skin and breathes nicely in the heat. The only downside is the funky tan lines, which is why I am sure to alternate shoes on my days off, especially if I plan to be outside for most of the day. If it were not for that, I think these might be the only shoes I'd wear all summer. If you are looking for a reasonable priced, comfortable shoe that you can wear and walk in all day.</td>\n",

Definitely along the lines of a sports bra squish effect.  The sides do come up high.  Glamorise is one the best brands for bras, so I'm very surprised with this one.  The front close idea appealed to me, but look carefully, there are 7 (yes, seven) clasps to do up.  What a pain.  I think if I had ordered 3 sizes up it might be ok.  I won't return it as I'm losing weight, so it might fit better down the road.  Will update review at that time.  If you want a bra that doesn't let you jiggle at all without it being a minimizer and/or without wires, this would be good.\\n\\nUPDATE:  After very recent gallbladder surgery that left me with a highly tender incision site, I found I couldn't wear any of my regular bras.  I had ordered this one hoping I might be able to tolerate it.  Initially, because it was so tight, I couldn't tolerate this one either.  As I slowly healed, I kept trying the bra.  Due to its elastic nature I was able to adjust this for comfort more than the others.  After about two weeks, much to my amazement, I found the bra had lost its initial snugness and was in fact VERY comfortable!  5 weeks after surgery and this is still the only bra I can tolerate.  The number of clasps in the front turned out to be a bonus as well, because I could choose to leave the bottom clasps undone, adding to the comfort level.  I am still of the opinion that it runs too snug and I'm glad I ordered up.\\n\\nTake the time to break the bra in!  All bras have a break-in period (in my opinion), and this one is no different.  I'm actually quite happy with it now.  \n",

It is a little large for my small size, but I think it is a nice fit.  The fabric is a nice thin material, but it is a little thin in the legs.  I wish it was thicker.  The material is soft and comfortable.  I will keep it.  I ordered a half size up and it fits great.  I wear a 9 1/2.  I like that the strap is longer than the waistband, which is nice.  I am 5'5\" and the size 6 fits great.  I am a medium.  The bra is too short.  It is a little narrow for me, but I think it would be a nice addition to my wardrobe.  I will be buying another one in different colors.  I have a small tummy and I ordered a medium.  I wear a 9 1/2 in pants.  I would recommend this bra.  I am 5'8\" and the length was perfect.  I love the color and it is very comfortable.\\nI would recommend this to anyone.I was very happy with this shirt!  It's very pretty and the fabric is soft and nice!  The fit is perfect!

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I ordered the size 6.5 and it fit perfectly. The fabric is a nice thin material and the color is vibrant. It's a little thin on me but it's worth it. The material is soft and comfortable. I love the color and the fit. I'm 5'4\" and it fits just right. I'm a size 6 and it's a bit long on me so I ordered a 6 in order to fit the smaller size. I'm 5'3\" and it fits perfect and I got it in a medium. It's a nice dress and I'm very pleased with it. I like that it's a bit small for me and I can wear it with a top or skirt. I also like that the fabric is made of a good material. I wear a size 5 and it fits well. I'm 5'3\" and it fits just right. I'm 5'6\" and it fits just right. I'm 5'4\" and it fits just right. I wear a size 10.5 and it's a little tight on me. I have a small waist and it's not too tight on me. It's a nice little dress. I will buy more colors.Very nice dress.  It is well made and it is very comfortable.  I received a free sample and will see if I can wear it again.  I would definitely buy another one.  I am very happy with this dress.I love these boots!

I've spent a ridiculous amount of money on high end dress shoes like Merrels and just have not been able to find a pair that are comfortable to wear all day. Both for my feet and my back. Enter the Sanuk yoga sling!!! These shoes are amazingly comfortable. Though, I will admit it took a few wears to get used to the feel of the yoga matte bottom. At first, it felt a little \"sticky\" to me, and the fabric part that goes through the toe area was a little thick and took some getting used to. I wore them for a few days before taking them out on a job and I can't get over how comfortable they are. Ii have been wearing these shoes now for 3 months, every work day and I am THRILLED. No more back pain, no more sore feet. I also wear these sometimes during my off time,mans every time I wear them, I get compliments on how cute and comfortable they look. The great thing about these shoes is the yoga matte bottom. It helps your feet grip to the shoe a bit, so your foot can just walk normally, without having to grip the shoe. You may not realize it, but with a lot of Sandals, your foot is having to work to keep the shoe on, changing the way you walk and stand and ultimately causing foot and back pain. Not with these! Also, the soft linen sits comfortably on your skin and breathes nicely in the heat. The only downside is the funky tan lines, which is why I am sure to alternate shoes on my days off, especially if I plan to be outside for most of the day.

I've spent a ridiculous amount of money on high end dress shoes like Merrels and just have not been able to find a pair that are comfortable to wear all day. Both for my feet and my back. Enter the Sanuk yoga sling!!! These shoes are amazingly comfortable. Though, I will admit it took a few wears to get used to the feel of the yoga matte bottom. At first, it felt a little \"sticky\" to me, and the fabric part that goes through the toe area was a little thick and took some getting used to. I wore them for a few days before taking them out on a job and I can't get over how comfortable they are. Ii have been wearing these shoes now for 3 months, every work day and I am THRILLED. No more back pain, no more sore feet. I also wear these sometimes during my off time,mans every time I wear them, I get compliments on how cute and comfortable they look. The great thing about these shoes is the yoga matte bottom. It helps your feet grip to the shoe a bit, so your foot can just walk normally, without having to grip the shoe. You may not realize it, but with a lot of Sandals, your foot is having to work to keep the shoe on, changing the way you walk and stand and ultimately causing foot and back pain. Not with these! Also, the soft linen sits comfortably on your skin and breathes nicely in the heat. The only downside is the funky tan lines, which is why I am sure to alternate shoes on my days off, especially if I plan to be outside for most of the day. If it were not for that, I think these might be the only shoes I'd wear all summer. If you are looking for a reasonable priced, comfortable shoe that you can wear and walk in all day.</td>\n",
