# A blog website built using Flask Framework

This webapp is built for demonstration purpose. 

I built a simple blog webapp that utilize the deep learning model created to filter the inputted review and show the label and its associative score. 

Ex. "Airbnb service fees and cleaning fees are ridiculous! Bad enough on price for stay plus tax. Try to book something nice for me and my boyfriend for a week in TN for my birthday and everything I would love to stay at is so damn expensive! I've never booked with airbnb before and would like to if prices weren't so ridiculous! People could still make $ even if the prices weren't so high!". This reviews is considered deceptive by the model with 84% deceptive.
